# Self-Driving-Car

This is all of the components to drive and control the Self Driving Car I have created in Unity. It uses sensors placed on the car to take in distances to the wall of the track and determine using a Nerual Network the next input for teh car to make. i.e Speed Up, Brake, Turn Right/Left or any combination.

Some Assets will be saved here to prevent having to remake then in the event they are lost from my personal system
